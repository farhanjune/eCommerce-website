                        The story begins in the springtime of our youth. Full of blurry dreams and aspirations,
                        each of us knew that we wanted to make something of ourselves, the question was 'what?'.
                        Throughout our high school years and into the early semesters of college, we studied
                        a variety of subjects, hungry for the knowledge that would guide us to our eventual success.
                    </p>
                    <p class="timeline">
                        Fast forward to the final semester of our undergraduate career at the University of Georgia.
                        We all met for the first time in the widely-coveted Web Programming course taught diligently
                        by the esteemed Dr. Sachin Meena. It was there that the fires of web development forged what
                        would become our collaborative genius.
                    </p>
                    <p class="timeline">
                        Though success did come, it didn't happen overnight. After graduation, we each set out to gain
                        experience and test our worth in the real world, far from the comfort of academia. It was
                        a rigorous introduction to the industry, but a very valuable lesson to us all.

                        After a few years spent working at various tech startups and big industry names which we
                        need not mention here, we finally reunited to continue the collective project we had
                        nurtured so long ago. It was thus that BuyTech was born, supported by our diverse expertise
                        and driven by the mission to provide the best consumer technology the industry has to offer!
